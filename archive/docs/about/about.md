This project was carried out by [Ayrton Bourn](https://github.com/AyrtonB), a PhD student at the UCL Energy Systems & AI Lab where his research focuses on wind power and electricty price forecasting. The development of the power station dictionary was funded through the Climate Subak Fellowship programme, "a Â£10k grant for individuals with an idea for an innovative, data-driven climate project". You can find out more information about the fellowship and apply [here](https://climatesubak.org/fellowship-apply#:~:text=A%20%C2%A310k%20grant%20for,Subak%20support%20and%20learning%20resources). A core goal of this work was to provide tools that could be used by both Subak and the wider open-data community, as well as supporting Ayrton's PhD work.
