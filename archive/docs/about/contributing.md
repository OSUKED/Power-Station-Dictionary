We need your help!

One of the main goals of the Data Shiro framework was to ensure that it was simple to link new information into the network, this page describes the different ways that you can contribute new data to the project. Some of the more common operations, such as adding new linked IDs, can be carried out through the completion of a Google form. The other way to contribute is by directly editing the files inside the Power Station Dictionary repository, here we'll detail exactly which components you will need to edit.

* Adding a new ID
* Adding a new ID type
* Adding a new power plant
* Adding a dataset (should link to the FD description page as well)
* Creating a new dictionary

### Adding a New ID

One of the easiest contributions to make is adding a new ID, it is also one of the most powerful as if there is already a linked dataset containing that ID then that data will be automatically ingested into the dictionary within the next hour. To do so you can either complete this Google sheet, or directly edit the dictionary spreadsheet through a pull request. If you use the contribution links provided on each entity page then the relevant dictionary id will be pre-populated.

### Adding a New ID Type

A new ID type is an identifier class that is not already being used in the dictionary, you can check what existing ID types are being used by inspecting the columns in the dictionary spreadsheet. Adding a new ID type is slightly more complex than adding a new ID, and involves editing both the dictionary spreadsheet (adding a new column), as well as editing the dictionary datapackage.json to include the new field (column). You can find out more information about how to add new fields to a Frictionless Data datapackage.json schema here. Optionally, you can also add the relevant information in this Google form and we will then carry out the integration steps ourselves as soon as possible.
