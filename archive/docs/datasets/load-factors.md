| load_hours  | number | default  | Full Load Hours | Full load hours are a quantity value that describes the utilization of a technical device. The value of the full load hours is obtained by dividing the annual amount of energy generated by the declared net capacity of the plant. For this analysis the net capacity was estimated by taking the maximum observed load over the full time-period | http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/OEO_00140144 |
