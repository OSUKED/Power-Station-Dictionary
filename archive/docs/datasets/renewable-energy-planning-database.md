# Renewable Energy Planning Database

[Homepage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-energy-planning-database-monthly-extract)

The Renewable Energy Planning Database ('REPD') is managed by Barbour ABI on behalf of the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy ('BEISâ€™). The databases track the progress of renewable electricity projects (including those that could also be used for CHP), and electricity storage projects  from inception, through planning, construction, operation and decommissioning.

The REPD is updated on a quarterly basis, and contains information on all Renewable Electricity and CHP projects up to the end of the previous calendar month.
