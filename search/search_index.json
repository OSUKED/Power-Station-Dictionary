Overview \u00b6 Existing work into increasing the visibility of energy data has focused on improving the ability of humans to find datasets, which has historically been a key issue within a highly fragmented energy data landscape. Groups such as the Energy Data Taskforce have prompted a new wave of metadata standardisation and data cataloguing initiatives which have gone a long way to solving this issue, opening up new opportunities such as the creation of digital twins of the power grid. However, these new opportunities bring new challenges. To enable a digital twin of the energy system we need to be able to \"describe relationships between assets and datasets\" , requiring two core extensions to our existing toolset: Field-level metadata that describes the contents of individual columns in a dataset \"Mapping\" datasets that are able to express the relationships between other datasets These additions enable us to move from improving the ability of humans to discover datasets to making it easier for machines to automatically find and extract relevant data - a need that will only increase as the number and size of datasets continues to grow. The benefits extend beyond our digital colleagues though - by pivoting data exploration to be about finding objects/assets, which then reveal the datasets (and attributes) they are linked to, we can create a more intuitive search experience. Similar to Google\u2019s move from searching for \"Things not Strings\" , the data dictionary lets us search for \"Assets not Datasets\". To illustrate the benefits of such a framework we are building a pilot dictionary focused on improving the discoverability, linkage, and automated extraction of data relating to power stations on the GB system. Power stations were chosen due to the high number of datasets they relate to, the wide range of ids used to describe them, and the current duplication in efforts to link them across industry and academia. We will then demonstrate how the dictionary can be used for analysis with two case studies: one researching the carbon intensity of individual generators by matching power output and carbon emission datasets, the second linking wholesale price and renewable subsidy data to help explain why wind subsidies have fallen below the average market price. You can read more about why we've created the dictionary and how it works in this blog post .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"index.html#welcome-to-the-power-station-dictionary","text":"The Power Station Dictionary is a site that enables mapping between various power plant ids and automatically extracts data relating to those plants from Frictionless Data packages.","title":"Welcome to the Power Station Dictionary!"},{"location":"index.html#overview","text":"Existing work into increasing the visibility of energy data has focused on improving the ability of humans to find datasets, which has historically been a key issue within a highly fragmented energy data landscape.

A core goal of this work was to provide tools that could be used by both Subak and the wider open-data community, as well as supporting Ayrton's PhD work.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/contributing.html","text":"We need your help! One of the main goals of the Data Shiro framework was to ensure that it was simple to link new information into the network, this page describes the different ways that you can contribute new data to the project. Some of the more common operations, such as adding new linked IDs, can be carried out through the completion of a Google form. The other way to contribute is by directly editing the files inside the Power Station Dictionary repository, here we'll detail exactly which components you will need to edit. Adding a new ID Adding a new ID type Adding a new power plant Adding a dataset (should link to the FD description page as well) Creating a new dictionary Adding a New ID \u00b6 One of the easiest contributions to make is adding a new ID, it is also one of the most powerful as if there is already a linked dataset containing that ID then that data will be automatically ingested into the dictionary within the next hour. To do so you can either complete this Google sheet, or directly edit the dictionary spreadsheet through a pull request. If you use the contribution links provided on each entity page then the relevant dictionary id will be pre-populated. Adding a New ID Type \u00b6 A new ID type is an identifier class that is not already being used in the dictionary, you can check what existing ID types are being used by inspecting the columns in the dictionary spreadsheet. Adding a new ID type is slightly more complex than adding a new ID, and involves editing both the dictionary spreadsheet (adding a new column), as well as editing the dictionary datapackage.json to include the new field (column). You can find out more information about how to add new fields to a Frictionless Data datapackage.json schema here. Optionally, you can also add the relevant information in this Google form and we will then carry out the integration steps ourselves as soon as possible.

The challenge of finding data is addressed by the cataloguing of datasets, as in the Subak Data Catalogue . However, once we have the datasets we are looking for, how do we match the data within each? For instance, consider the issue of agreeing on how to refer to a particular power plant. It might be that one dataset refers to the \u201cDrax Power Station\u201d, whilst another dataset might just call it \u201cDRAX\u201d. We assume that rolling out a fully-fledged unique name for each power plant is not possible, so we create a dictionary that contains a list of unique power plant names in a primary dataset and then matches them to equivalent names in external datasets. This blog outlines the motivation behind, and application of, a tool we have created to address these issues. What Is It? \u00b6 The ability to describe relationships between assets and datasets is a key piece of digital infrastructure that is needed to produce reports on the current state of the system or enable innovations such as digital twins of the energy system. To this end we created the Data Shiro library, which takes datasets in any form (and their metadata) as inputs, stores the connections between datasets and then outputs a combined view of all the extracted data: a machine-readable knowledge graph describing the links between assets and their associated data, as well as a website that compiles this information: letting the user traverse between the datasets and see the extracted information on individual assets. Taking a decentralised approach to this by directly linking to external data sources helps ensure that information remains up to date whilst also providing flexibility for it to scale as new datasets are added to the network. What Does This Give You? \u00b6 Firstly, many of these connections between datasets are already created by individuals or organisations, the issue is that they are rarely then made available to the wider community. Even when connections between datasets are published they are often not done so in a standardised format, making it difficult to combine and develop them further. A central place to store and maintain dictionaries allows anyone to link between multiple different data assets. Additionally, by creating a common language for linking datasets together we can begin to build tools that can be used across a much wider data ecosystem. A further benefit with dictionaries is that we can use them to create a knowledge graph, allowing users to intuitively traverse the many linked datasets and semantically understand the relationships between assets and their data. Providing this semantic understanding is key to enabling more complex search queries, e.g. \u201cFind the total capacity of all onshore wind farms which have experienced curtailment in 2020\u201d, which will become increasingly more important as the data landscape grows and becomes more complex. And lastly, we create a website that displays an aggregate view of the data but split by the entity it relates to rather than the dataset, making it easier to compare across different sources. How Do We Do This? \u00b6 The glue behind all of this is the metadata describing both the dictionary IDs spreadsheet and the datasets that the dictionary is linked to. Commonly used metadata specifications such as DCAT (a vocabulary for dataset catalogues) describe the dataset as a whole, providing information on the author, date of creation, etc. The Frictionless Data metadata standard, which we use to describe the datasets linked to the dictionary, makes it possible to describe individual columns within a dataset (such as a spreadsheet) with information such as the field name, units, and data type. We have then extended the Frictionless metadata standard to create a new dictionary schema, which can link between common identifiers in the dictionary IDs CSV and those contained within the external datasets. Essentially, by linking Frictionless datasets with a dictionary we can now understand what individual cells within a spreadsheet are describing. These additions enable us to move from improving the ability of humans to discover datasets to making it easier for machines to automatically find and extract relevant data - a need that will only increase as the number and size of datasets continues to grow. The benefits extend beyond our digital colleagues though - by pivoting data exploration to be about finding objects/assets, which then reveal the datasets (and attributes) they are linked to, we can create a more intuitive search experience. Similar to Google\u2019s move from searching for \"Things not Strings\", the data dictionary lets us search for \"Assets not Datasets\". Challenges \u00b6 There are still challenges along the way, as with any such construction. Managing many-to-one relationships * Currently, the dictionary can handle one-to-one (e.g. different names for the same power station) and one-to-many (e.g. the different generators that make up a power station) relationships directly through the IDs dataset. * Many-to-one relationships (such as linking power stations to the companies that owe them) are not handled through the IDs dataset but instead can be linked from external resources as with any other entity attribute (like fuel type). Maintenance * Long-term stewardship of a linked data project is difficult - source URLs disappear, IDs change, and growing complexity adds barriers for new contributors. * We\u2019ve aimed to mitigate these issues as much as possible through automated CI/CD, clear documentation, and modular design of the code-base itself. * By building on existing metadata specifications and open-source tools we also reduce the cognitive overhead needed to get to grips with the Data Shiro library. * Furthermore, we\u2019ve introduced a series of simple Google forms which can be used to easily add new IDs and datasets to the power station dictionary. Mapping between metadata * The dictionary is built around being able to link together datasets described using the Frictionless Data metadata specification, however, many datasets use alternative specifications such as CKAN and DCAT. * To address this we are building mappers which are able to convert between these different specifications. * Initially, we have focussed our efforts on mapping between common open metadata standards such as CKAN (used by NG, WPD, and LCCC), however, in the long-term we are looking to include mappers from less common specifications such as the one developed by IB1 as part of the MEDA competition. Way Forwards \u00b6 To illustrate the benefits of such a framework we are building a pilot dictionary focused on improving the discoverability, linkage, and automated extraction of data relating to power stations on the UK system. Power stations were chosen as the first case study due to the high number of datasets they relate to, the wide range of ids used to describe them, and the current duplication in efforts to link them across industry and academia. We're also developing examples that demonstrate how to use the outputted knowledge graph to create a combined/cleaned dataset, as well as entirely new derived data such as calculating carbon intensity from absolute emissions and power output.","title":"Making Sense of (Energy) Data"},{"location":"blog/launch.html#what-is-it","text":"The ability to describe relationships between assets and datasets is a key piece of digital infrastructure that is needed to produce reports on the current state of the system or enable innovations such as digital twins of the energy system.
